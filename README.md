# Time-Series-Analysis-of-Tesla-Stock
This portfolio project will be a Time Series Analysis of Tesla's stock using Alpha Vantage's API.


The goal of this Time Series project was to analyze Tesla's stock trend using Alpha Vantage, comparing the Simple Moving Averages with the actual Closing Prices. 

I will aim to demonstrate both the code and the stock market aspect, in a way that a non-technical or inexperienced audience will understand!
